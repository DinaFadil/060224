/*As member variables 'testNo' and 'desc' are declared with no explicit access specifier, this means these variables have package scope, hence these variables are accessible only to classes within the same package. Hence, no changes are necessary.

If you use private, then instance variables will not be accessible to any other classes, even within the same package.

If you use protected, then instance variables will be accessible to the subclasses outside 'com.udayankhattry.oca' package.

If you use public, then instance variables will be accessible to all the classes. */
